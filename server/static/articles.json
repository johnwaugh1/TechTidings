The vulnerability, assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-7344  (CVSS score: 6.7), resides in a UEFI application signed by Microsoft's \"Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011\" third-party UEFI certificate, according to a new report  from ESET shared with The Hacker News.  Successful exploitation of the flaw can lead to the execution of untrusted code during system boot, thereby enabling attackers to deploy malicious UEFI bootkits on machines that have Secure Boot on, irrespective of the operating system installed.
