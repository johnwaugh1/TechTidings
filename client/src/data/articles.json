A draft version of the model, which has been conceived in collaboration with Niyo 'Little Thunder' Pearson, Red Balloon Security, and Narf Industries, was previously released on December 13, 2023. EMB 3 D, like the ATT&CK framework , is expected to be a \"living framework,\" with new and mitigations added and updated over time as new actors, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors emerge, but with a specific focus on embedded devices.

The issues, which were uncovered in the IP defragmentation algorithm implemented in U-Boot by NCC Group, could be abused to achieve arbitrary out-of-bounds write and denial-of-service (Do S). U-Boot is a boot loader used in Linux-based embedded systems such as Chrome OS as well as ebook readers such as Amazon Kindle and Kobo e Reader. The issues are summarized below - CVE-2022-30790 (CVSS score: 9.6) - Hole Descriptor overwrite in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation leads to an arbitrary out-of-bounds write primitive. CVE-2022-30552 (CVSS score: 7.1) - Large buffer overflow leads to Do S in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation code It's worth noting that both the flaws are exploitable only from the local network. But doing so can enable an attacker to root the devices and lead to a Do S by crafting a malformed packet. The s...",

With cloud adoption dramatically increasing the ease of exposing new systems and services to the internet, prioritizing threats and managing your attack surface from an attacker's perspective has never been more important. In this guide, we look at why attack surfaces are growing and how to monitor and manage them properly with tools like Intruder . Let's dive in. What is your attack surface? First, it's important to understand what we mean when we talk about an attack surface. An attack surface is the sum of your digital assets that are 'reachable' by an attacker \u2013 whether they are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not. You can also have both internal and external attack surfaces - imagine for example a malicious email attachment landing in a colleague's inbox, vs a new FTP server being...",

The six flaws were reported by researchers from Israeli Io T security firm Vdoo. The Realtek RTL 8195 A module is a standalone, low-power-consumption Wi-Fi hardware module targeted at embedded devices used in several industries such as agriculture, smart home, healthcare, gaming, and automotive sectors. It also makes use of an \"Ameba\" API, allowing developers to communicate with the device via Wi-Fi, HTTP, and MQTT , a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices. Although the issues uncovered by Vdoo were verified only on RTL 8195 A, the researchers said they extend to other modules as well, including RTL 8711 AM, RTL 8711 AF, and RTL 8710 AF.

With cloud adoption dramatically increasing the ease of exposing new systems and services to the internet, prioritizing threats and managing your attack surface from an attacker's perspective has never been more important. In this guide, we look at why attack surfaces are growing and how to monitor and manage them properly with tools like Intruder . Let's dive in. What is your attack surface? First, it's important to understand what we mean when we talk about an attack surface. An attack surface is the sum of your digital assets that are 'reachable' by an attacker \u2013 whether they are secure or vulnerable, known or unknown, in active use or not. You can also have both internal and external attack surfaces - imagine for example a malicious email attachment landing in a colleague's inbox, vs a new FTP server being...",

The intrusion leveraged the now-patched vulnerabilities to gain initial access and maintain persistent remote access to an unspecified target network, cybersecurity company Field Effect said in a report shared with The Hacker News. \"The attack involved the quick and deliberate execution of several post-compromise tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) including network and system discovery, administrator account creation, and the establishment of persistence mechanisms, which could have led to the deployment of ransomware,\" security researchers Ryan Slaney and Daniel Albrecht said . The vulnerabilities in question, CVE-2024-57726, CVE-2024-57727, and CVE-2024-57728 , were disclosed by Horizon 3.ai last month. Successful exploitation of the security holes could allow f...",

The total amount extorted during the first half of 2024 stood at $459.8 million, blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis said, adding payment activity slumped after July 2024 by about 3.94%. \"The number of ransomware events increased into H 2, but on-chain payments declined, suggesting that more victims were targeted, but fewer paid,\" the company said . Adding to the challenges is an increasingly fragmented ransomware ecosystem, which, in the wake of the collapse of Lock Bit and Black Cat, has led to the emergence of a lot of newcomers that have eschewed big game hunting in favor of small- to mid-size entities that, in turn, translate to more modest ransom demands. According to data compiled by Coveware, the average ransomware payment in Q 4 2024 was at $553,959, up from $479,237 in Q 3 .

The attacks leverage an optical character recognition (OCR) model to exfiltrate select images containing wallet recovery phrases from photo libraries to a command-and-control (C 2) server, Kaspersky researchers Dmitry Kalinin and Sergey Puzan said in a technical report. The moniker is a reference to an embedded software development kit (SDK) that employs a Java component called Spark that masquerades as an analytics module. It's currently not known whether the infection was a result of a supply chain attack or if it was intentionally introduced by the developers.
