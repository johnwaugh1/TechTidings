The issues, which were uncovered in the IP defragmentation algorithm implemented in U-Boot by NCC Group, could be abused to achieve arbitrary out-of-bounds write and denial-of-service (Do S). U-Boot is a boot loader used in Linux-based embedded systems such as Chrome OS as well as ebook readers such as Amazon Kindle and Kobo e Reader. The issues are summarized below - CVE-2022-30790 (CVSS score: 9.6) - Hole Descriptor overwrite in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation leads to an arbitrary out-of-bounds write primitive. CVE-2022-30552 (CVSS score: 7.1) - Large buffer overflow leads to Do S in U-Boot IP packet defragmentation code It's worth noting that both the flaws are exploitable only from the local network.

The six flaws were reported by researchers from Israeli Io T security firm Vdoo. The Realtek RTL 8195 A module is a standalone, low-power-consumption Wi-Fi hardware module targeted at embedded devices used in several industries such as agriculture, smart home, healthcare, gaming, and automotive sectors. It also makes use of an \"Ameba\" API, allowing developers to communicate with the device via Wi-Fi, HTTP, and MQTT , a lightweight messaging protocol for small sensors and mobile devices.
